The goal of this project was to build a living CV that is easy to read, and easy to update. To do this I chose the following stack:

- **Next.js** to take advantage of Server Side Rendering. The easy wins here come mostly from SSR for SEO, and speed and the nextjs project structure for easy guidance on how to build it out.
- **Material UI** was used as a component library for quick development. The benefits here come in the form of blah blah blah
